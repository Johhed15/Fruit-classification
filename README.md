# This repository contains a fruit classification problem solved with a CNN-model!

The code is written in pythonon on kaggle!

The model used to solve this problem is a CNNN model and i have utilized some of the tructure and weights from the VGG16 model to get 100 % accuracy on the test dataset!

Comments are made in swedish as i did this on my spare time before my master.
